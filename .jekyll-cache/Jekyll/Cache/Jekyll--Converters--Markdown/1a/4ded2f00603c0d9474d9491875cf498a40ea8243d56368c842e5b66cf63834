Welcome to my realm!</p>

<p class="text-justify">In May 2003, I received my Master of Computer Application from the University of Chennai. Programming was challenging for me. To remain in IT, I opted to take a detour via Hardware and Networking. Now that programming is necessary, I have learned Python, which is very basic for automatons. Now Iâ€™m learning Git to post all my notes and references. In addition, Iâ€™m stashing my works on this site for my wireless expert-level certification. With the hope that it will benefit anybody who wanders across my website.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="text-justify">Iâ€™ve always been interested in wireless. It is a kind of magic that transmits data over the air. During the pandemic, I decided to get my vendor-neutral wireless certification, from CWNP. I completed all the prerequisites and am now preparing for the CWNE.</p>
