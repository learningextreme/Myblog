I"ß<p class="text-justify">Loop occurrence is a common issue at Layer two and three. Let us focus on layer three in this article. Routing loops can get identified when we try to ping the destination by receiving the ICMP message, â€œpacket expired in transitâ€.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s have a simple topology to understand it better.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/MiniTest/assets/images/neighbor.png" alt="Neighbor" class="align-center" /></p>

<p class="text-justify">The router â€œRDâ€ has a forwarding entry point to the neighbor router â€œRCâ€ to reach the segment â€œYâ€, presume that â€œRCâ€ lost the connectivity to segment â€œYâ€, which is on in it. However, there is an update coming from â€œRDâ€ (the entire route database), â€œRCâ€ sees that there is the path to reach the segment â€œYâ€ through the neighbor router â€œRDâ€; therefore, â€œRCâ€ will update its routing table accordingly. â€œRDâ€ had learnt this update from â€œRCâ€ in the earlier route exchange process. Letâ€™s see the issue here, A datagram coming from the Segment â€œXâ€ to â€œYâ€ has to go through â€œRDâ€ and â€œRCâ€. Hence, â€œRDâ€ will forward the datagram to â€œRCâ€. â€œRCâ€ will send it back to â€œRDâ€ because â€œRCâ€ believes the segment â€œYâ€ can be reachable through the neighbor â€œRDâ€ it goes on and on until the TTL expires.</p>

<p class="text-justify">The duration of this problem may depend on the protocol that is in use. RIP will rip us into two and, OSPF will tackle by itself with its intelligence. The concern while the problem is surfacing what happened to the sensitive data. How it occurs in the OSPF, letâ€™s take this topology.</p>

<p>Topology explanation:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/MiniTest/assets/images/ospf.png" alt="Topology" class="align-center" /></p>

<p class="text-justify">Five routers connected each other in the topology; the green dotted circles illustrate the actual route path; the blue dotted circle shows an alternate route path in case of link/router has broken.</p>

<p class="text-justify">It means, â€œRAâ€ -&gt; â€œRBâ€, â€œRBâ€ -&gt; â€œRCâ€, â€œRCâ€ -&gt; â€œRDâ€, â€œRDâ€ -&gt; â€œREâ€, and â€œREâ€ -&gt; â€œRAâ€.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Assume â€œRAâ€ lost its link that goes to â€œRBâ€, â€œRAâ€ will switch to its alternate path to reach â€œRBâ€œ through â€œREâ€, so far â€œREâ€ knows to orbit to â€œRBâ€ through â€œRAâ€. In this instance, the datagram will get ping ponged between â€œREâ€ and â€œRAâ€. However, this loop will get mitigated by the OSPF protocol itself because of the trigger update feature. However, there is a loop for some microseconds, which is called â€œmicro-loopâ€.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Why do we need to concern about it, when it is going to surface for a few microseconds?</p>

<p class="text-justify">When Smart-city CCTV camera data goes back to the Media Server. When healthcare medical instruments communicating with one another.</p>

<p class="text-justify">It is important give thought about it!</p>
